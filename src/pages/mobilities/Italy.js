            We travelled all day. We took a flight from Asturias to Barcelona,
            then from Barcelona to Naples. In Naples a bus was wating for us to
            take us to Salerno.

          <div className="mainBody">
            On the first day we went to Pompei. Pompei is a city located in the
            south of Italy, that in the 79 d.C. was covered by ashes and a toxic
            cloud realeased by Vesuvius volcano. We could see how people lived
            in the ancient Rome because the ashes covered and preserved the
            rests of the city. The excavation to remove the 6 metres of layers
            started around the 18. century, so they discovered this spectacular
            and wellpreserved city. We walked through the streets and we learned
            about their lifestyle. We could see the corpses of the inhabitants
            that are actually a capsule of dry stone and ashes. We ate at 12 pm
            a sandwich and fruit and then we continued our visit. Finally we ate
            lunch in a fantastic restaurant. We came back to the "Istituto", the
            hall of residence, by train and dinner was in MacDonald's. It was a
            rainy day but we had lots of fun and we learned a lot.

          <div className="mainBody">
            On Monday we got up at 7 a.m. Then, we took a tour around the city
            of Salerno. We had a walk next to the sea with the help of our
            Italian guides, students and teacher of the Liceo, who explained us
            about the most important parts of the city. We visited the town
            hall, where we met Ms Gaetana Falcone, the local representative of
            the Ministry of Education who welcomed us in Salerno. Later we
            visited the most important theatre of the city and a historical
            cathedral called San Mateo. After visiting the historical buildings,
            the Italian students showed us their highschool where they studied,
            and we were able to see different classrooms. Then, we had lunch in
            a restaurant and we returned to the student hall because we had to
            present our Genially presentation to the students from the other
            countriers. The topic was gender inequality. In the evening we had
            dinner in a restaurant and finally we walked back to the hostal.

            On Tuesday morning, we visited a buffalo farm which is also a
            mozarella factory. We got to know how mozzarella is made and we
            could have a taste. Then we went to Paestum and we saw many
            "frescos" from inside the tombs of people of the Magna Graecia. We
            also visited a few temples, like Neptune's or Atenea's. We had lunch
            in a restaurant next to the museum. Later on, we went shopping to a
            market. There were many Christmas' decorations and lots of lights.
            We spent there the evening and finally we headed to the "Istituto"
            where we had dinner.

          <div className="mainBody">
            On Wednesday morning we walked to the Italian high school, where we
            created a "thinglink" about a typical dish of our country. Everyone
            presented their dish to the others, explaining the recipes. Then, we
            formed mixed groups with the other students. In pairs, we had to
            create a small sketch about a stereotype from a random country, and
            the rest had to guess which country was being represented. After
            having lunch in the afternoon, we wento to a NGO who helped
            non-accompanied children from all over the world. There, many
            volunteers - college students, retired teachers, etc.- helped them
            to do their homework. Some of them knew how to speak more languages
            too. We had some free time around the city, so we went shopping for
            a while before having dinner at a pizzeria. Finally we returned to
            the "Istituto" to sleep.

            On Thursday we divided into mixed groups of Italians, Latvians,
            Romanians and Spaniards and we created a poster with Canva. Later,
            when we finished it, we voted for the best poster and after that we
            played Kahoot with questions about gender equality. Then, we had
            free time and after that we went to Pizzamania for lunch. After
            lunch we visited the "Giardino della Minerva", which is a historical
            therapeutic botanical garden located in the upper side of the
            Medieval town. It rained a lot and we went to the "Istituto" to get
            dry. At night we went to the Greek restaurant "Mythos", and finally
            we came back again to the hostal.

            Friday was the last day and we did some activities of assessment and
            summarising. To begin, we watched two videos about gender bias.
            After that, we worked in the same groups as the previous day and
            read some selected news about gender inequality. These texts should
            be used to make a short film. The idea of the film was to simulate a
            news programme with one newsreader and two correspondants who
            interviewed the students asking questions about the project. We had
            to shoot the scenes on a green screen but it was difficult because
            the green cloth had many wrinckles.

          We also filled a form to assess the project period in Salerno. 
          We had lunch at Pizzamania again and after that we enjoyed a free afernoon and evening with our new friends.

            On Saturday we left the "Istituto" at 7 a.m. We were sad that the
            school trip had finished and that we had to say goodbye to many new
            friends. We took two planes from Naples to Barcelona and from
            Barcelona to Asturias. The journey back was much shorter than the
            trip to Italy. It would have been perfect if four of our bags hadn't
            been lost. Fortunately we got our luggage back two days after our
            arrival.
