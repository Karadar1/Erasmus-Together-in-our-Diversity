            We travelled all day. We took a flight from Asturias to Barcelona,
            then from Barcelona to Naples. In Naples a bus was wating for us to
            take us to Salerno.

          <div className="mainBody">
            On the first day we went to Pompei. Pompei is a city located in the
            south of Italy, that in the 79 d.C. was covered by ashes and a toxic
            cloud realeased by Vesuvius volcano. We could see how people lived
            in the ancient Rome because the ashes covered and preserved the
            rests of the city. The excavation to remove the 6 metres of layers
            started around the 18. century, so they discovered this spectacular
            and wellpreserved city. We walked through the streets and we learned
            about their lifestyle. We could see the corpses of the inhabitants
            that are actually a capsule of dry stone and ashes. We ate at 12 pm
            a sandwich and fruit and then we continued our visit. Finally we ate
            lunch in a fantastic restaurant. We came back to the "Istituto", the
            hall of residence, by train and dinner was in MacDonald's. It was a
            rainy day but we had lots of fun and we learned a lot.

          <div className="mainBody">
            On Monday we got up at 7 a.m. Then, we took a tour around the city
            of Salerno. We had a walk next to the sea with the help of our
            Italian guides, students and teacher of the Liceo, who explained us
            about the most important parts of the city. We visited the town
            hall, where we met Ms Gaetana Falcone, the local representative of
            the Ministry of Education who welcomed us in Salerno. Later we
            visited the most important theatre of the city and a historical
            cathedral called San Mateo. After visiting the historical buildings,
            the Italian students showed us their highschool where they studied,
            and we were able to see different classrooms. Then, we had lunch in
            a restaurant and we returned to the student hall because we had to
            present our Genially presentation to the students from the other
            countriers. The topic was gender inequality. In the evening we had
            dinner in a restaurant and finally we walked back to the hostal.
